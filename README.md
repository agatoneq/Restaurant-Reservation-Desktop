# Restaurant Reservation System
## Description
This project is a Windows Forms application (.NET Framework) written in C#. It allows users to make reservations at a restaurant that also hosts events in a banquet hall. The reservation process involves several steps, following on-screen instructionsâ€”sometimes entering information, other times selecting an option from available choices. The application also enables users to view registered reservations by providing the appropriate login credentials. The system can be used both by clients and employees (system administrators).

To store data, you need to create a local database.
